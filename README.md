##_store your vessels until they are needed_##

***
###WARNING: this is still BETA. There should be bugs. 
While fixing them and implementing new features I'll try as hard as I can to maintain backward compatibility, _I can't guarantee it_. So if you plan to use it in your main game, **backup your saves**.

##Introduction##

Have you ever wanted to launch 5 satellites in one go? You did so? Then how about 10?
Does your maintenance ship orbit Kerbal without work for the third month with that lonely Kerberonaut on board?
Do you wish to build a giant space carrier filled with scouts, landing moduls and so on, but _with the part count below a hundred?_
Are you tired of the rovers that are so rarely needed now that your colony is fully functional, but still eat their share of CPU cycles each time you switch to the place?
