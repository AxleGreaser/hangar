###ChangeLog###
* v1.1.0
    * Added Rover Lander Hangar to easily land rovers on planetary bodies
    * Added (proper) support for TAC Life Support, RemoteTech2 and DeadlyReentry (a heatshield for Rover Lander is included)
    * Added recalculation of the amounts of resources on part resize, as well as several other properties of some modules. Unfortunately, I have to replicate some of TweakScale's functionality here; my part resizer is more specialized and TweakScale can't replace it, as much as want it to.
    * [Fixed issues](https://github.com/allista/hangar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
* v1.0.5324 -- Initial release
