###ChangeLog###
* v1.1.1.1 - **Hotfix for the [issue #42](https://github.com/allista/hangar/issues/42)**
    * Rovers are now launched at the planet/moon where the launching hangar is landed. Sorry for that stupid bug ^_^'
    * Improved DropDownList: ScrollView now takes all the space to the bottom of the window and the button is wide enough to contain the longest item from the list. Also numbering of items starts from 1 now.
* v1.1.1
    * Added support for the stock AppLauncher. **The Toolbar is no longer required**, but _it takes priority over the AppLauncher_ if installed.
    * Added option to show in Editor arrows indicating ship's forward and downward directions; such arrows are also shown for each hangar indicating orientation of a launched vessel. This should be especially **helpful in rover construction**, as rover's orientation often differs from the orientation of its control part.
    * Added names to hangars and an option to rename a hangar through a context menu.
    * **Removed docking ports from the _ground_ hangars**. If you have something somehow docked to these ports, **undock it prior to updating**.
    * Important bugfixes ([see the full list](https://github.com/allista/hangar/issues?q=milestone%3A%22v1.1.1+-+multiple+bugfixes+and+some+improvements%22+is%3Aclosed+-label%3Atask+-label%3Ainvalid)):
        * Fixed the problem with friction between rover wheels and hangar's floor.
        * GUI Windows are now constrained to the screen boundaries.
        * Hangar selector is now shown only if there're multiple hangars in the same vessel.
        * A ship with launch clamps cannot be stored inside a hangar in Editor anymore.
* v1.1.0
    * Added Rover Lander Hangar to easily land rovers on planetary bodies
    * Added (proper) support for TAC Life Support, RemoteTech2 and DeadlyReentry (a heatshield for Rover Lander is included)
    * Added recalculation of the amounts of resources on part resize, as well as several other properties of some modules. Unfortunately, I have to replicate some of TweakScale's functionality here; my part resizer is more specialized and TweakScale can't replace it, as much as want it to.
    * [Fixed issues](https://github.com/allista/hangar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed): 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17
    * Hotfixed Spaceport tech tree position (1:34, 7 Aug 14) 
* v1.0.5324 -- Initial release
